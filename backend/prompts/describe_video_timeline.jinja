Describe the video content as a detailed timeline broken down by second ranges.

For each segment, provide:
- `start_second` and `end_second`
- A concise description of the visuals, actions, and any on-screen text
- Notable audio or narration that occurs

Identify any frames that should be captured as screenshots by supplying:
- The specific second and millisecond to capture
- A short justification for why the frame is important

Return the results as structured JSON with two top-level keys:
- `timeline`: an ordered list of segments
- `screenshots`: an ordered list of screenshot suggestions

Be direct, factual, and keep descriptions brief but informative.
